# OS LAB TEST PROGRAMs
NOTE: For all the scheduling algorithms write the expected output for the given data (table with set
of processes, AT, BT) along with the Gantt chart. Execute the scheduling program for the same data.
The output should be in the form of table with all the necessary time parameters like AT, BT, CT, TT
and WT. Also display the Gantt chart and average WT.

7. A. Write a program to simulate grep command using system calls
   B. Write a program to generate and print Fibonacci series with the following requirements: -
   Parent program should create a child and distribute the task of generating Fibonacci no to
   its child.

- The code for generating Fibonacci no. should reside in different program. -
  Child should write the generated Fibonacci sequence to a shared memory. -Parent process has to print by retrieving the Fibonacci sequence from the shared memory. i) Implement the above using shmget and shmat
  Note: Shared object should be removed at the end in the program
